                  <p>
                    The purpose of taking a recent photo of the applicant and
                    uploading the identity to the system is to verify the
                    identity of the laboratory, reduce fraud and manipulation,
                    and achieve fairness and integrity of the test. - The
                    identity verification of the laboratory is done
                    automatically, and the identity verification will be
                    confirmed by employees (for applicants) and female employees
                    (for applicants) who are only authorized to access
                    personally identifiable information. These employees have
                    pledged to secure the confidentiality of this information in
                    accordance with the regulations in force in the Kingdom of
                    Saudi Arabia.

                    in order not to be subject to cancellation of the test or
                    legal liability. Here are a number of caveats that you
                    should pay attention to:

                        that it belongs to you and that any attempt to raise a
                        false identity or impersonate another person or
